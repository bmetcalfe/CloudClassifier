This is an exploratory project on how to implement a classification task on satelite imagery.

Its coming from a place of curiosity and ending up in a place with a few answers, but mostly more curiosity.  I learned a lot along the way, and look forward to being able to apply these ideas to future projects.

Some caviats about this repo:

There are many pieces of code pooled from a large number of sources.  Ive cited as many as I could, but if there are any obvious lapses, I will do my best to cite those as well.

The libraries used in this are pieced together from several Kaggle notebooks that others have used successfuly on this project.  I dont claim to be an expert in any of them, but did find most of them very approachable and user friendly once I understood what was going on "under the hood" a little bit.  I tried to include links to documentation when applicable for anyone interested in following up.

This repo will require downloading the cloud dataset from Kaggle (~6ish GB) before attempting to run it.  It was also designed to be executed with a dedicatd GPU to handle the computations.  I wouldnt suggest trying it at home on your 386 machine.

Run time on GTX 1080ti was north of 6hours.

Huge Thank You to:

GENERAL ASSEMBLY and its great DATA SCIENCE IMMERSIVE course.
    Without it, I would not have been so bold as to attept a task like this.
